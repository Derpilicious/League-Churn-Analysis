The League of Legends Churn analysis aims to predict whether new players of Riot's "League of Legends" will reach level 3 within one month of their first match using gameplay data. 

Given the significant time investment required for new players to reach this level, the project focuses on understanding early player behavior and identifying factors that influence player retention. 

Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, including logistic regression and neural networks, the project achieved a test set accuracy of around 78%.

The findings highlight key factors such as total damage dealt and average gold earned, providing insights into player engagement and potential interventions to reduce churn.
